                    Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He is a primary antagonist in the
                    original trilogy, but, as Anakin Skywalker, is the main protagonist of the prequel trilogy. Star
                    Wars creator George Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise
                    as "the tragedy of Darth Vader."

                    Originally a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force, Anakin Skywalker is lured to the dark
                    side of the Force by Palpatine and becomes a Sith Lord. After fighting a lightsaber battle with his
                    former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi in which he is dismembered, Vader is transformed into a cyborg. He then
                    serves the Galactic Empire as Darth Vader until he redeems himself by saving his son, Luke
                    Skywalker, and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process. He is also the father
                    of Princess Leia, the secret husband of Padm√© Amidala, and grandfather of Kylo Ren, the main villain
                    of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.

                    The character has been portrayed by numerous actors. His cinematic appearances span the first six
                    Star Wars films, as well as Rogue One, and he is referenced in both The Force Awakens and The Last
                    Jedi. He also appears in television series (most substantially The Clone Wars) and numerous
                    iterations of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, including video games, novels, and comic books.

            Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. His role as a tragic hero in the prequel trilogy was met with

                    Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He is a primary antagonist in the
                    original trilogy, but, as Anakin Skywalker, is the main protagonist of the prequel trilogy. Star
                    Wars creator George Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise
                    as "the tragedy of Darth Vader."

                    Originally a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force, Anakin Skywalker is lured to the dark
                    side of the Force by Palpatine and becomes a Sith Lord. After fighting a lightsaber battle with his
                    former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi in which he is dismembered, Vader is transformed into a cyborg. He then
                    serves the Galactic Empire as Darth Vader until he redeems himself by saving his son, Luke
                    Skywalker, and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process. He is also the father
                    of Princess Leia, the secret husband of Padmé Amidala, and grandfather of Kylo Ren, the main villain
                    of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.

                    The character has been portrayed by numerous actors. His cinematic appearances span the first six
                    Star Wars films, as well as Rogue One, and he is referenced in both The Force Awakens and The Last
                    Jedi. He also appears in television series (most substantially The Clone Wars) and numerous
                    iterations of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, including video games, novels, and comic books.

                    Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among
                    the greatest villains and fictional characters ever. The American Film Institute listed him as
                    the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, behind
                    Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. His role as a tragic hero in the prequel trilogy was met with
                    positive reviews

            In the first draft of The Star Wars, tall, grim general "Darth Vader" was already close in line with his
            final depiction, and the protagonist Annikin Starkiller had a role similar to that of his son Luke's as the
            16-year-old son of a respected warrior.[15] Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served
            the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler. In developing the backstory for The
            Empire Strikes Back, Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader.[16]

            After the success of the original Star Wars (1977), Lucas hired science fiction author Leigh Brackett to
            write the sequel with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a
            handwritten treatment. The treatment is similar to the final film, except that Vader does not reveal he is
            Luke's father. In the first draft that Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to
            instruct Luke.[17] Lucas was disappointed with the script, but Brackett died of cancer before he could
            discuss it with her.[18] With no writer available, Lucas had to write the next draft himself. In this draft,
            he made use of a new plot twist: Vader claiming to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft
            enjoyable to write, as opposed to the year-long struggles writing the first film.[19]
